/* The code is importing the `jest-dom` library which adds custom matchers to Jest for asserting on DOM
nodes. This allows developers to write more expressive and readable tests for their web
applications. The comment provides an example of one of the custom matchers, `toHaveTextContent`,
which checks if an element has a specific text content. The comment also provides a link to the
`jest-dom` GitHub repository for more information. */
